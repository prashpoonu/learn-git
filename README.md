# Learn GitHub

While it's possible to do all your coding on GitHub, we strongly advise against this. You're much further ahead to code with a dedicated text editor, locally, and push your changes up to GitHub. We're just using this approach now so we can create some changes in our remote repository that we can practice pulling down locally.
